# Data-Modelling-and-Analysis

This Project was made for my Databases course in Warsaw University of Technology where  I designed
a database for Movie Catalog that stores 100’s of movies.I have attached a PDF of my exact project tasks along with my report and SQL code.Here's a brief intro on what  I have done in the tasks.
In the
First three stages I designed the ER-diagram required for my
task,created tables and filled in the tables with records matching
the columns and then I created a few Index’s that I thought
would be useful in the later stages of the task where I had
to write **Select** statement queries to gather insights on the tasks assigned  and as proper Indexes help in selection of data as it makes its
performance better.
In the last  stage I had to write a Stored
Procedure for automatic detection of Production delays along
with them I prove if my written queries produce the desired
output result.
